# Josephus-Problem
There are 'n' soldiers standing in a circle and there's exactly one horse for the escaping. The war head picks up a random number 'k' and starts counting in a circular fashion from an assumed 0th position. While counting, when he reaches the count, everytime that soldier gets killed. This continues until only one soldier remains and he will be allowed to ride the horse and will be let free. Write a C program to implement the above scenario. The program must read initial number of soldiers, k and it must print the soldier's number who will survive.
